# Swing's AI Learning Journey

This repository is to share my personal experience about learning AI/ML models and tools by building some demo programs and Apps. Also, I will share the problems I met, how I solved them and the lessons I learned. Those demos might be simple, but they are basic enough to learn the fundamental concepts for those popular Models/Tools. 

Again, my knowledge is based on my personal experience, the best way to learn is to **DO IT YOURSELF!**  It's always never too late to start **NOW!**

## About Me
I am a Product Manager specilized in AI/ML platforms. My last product is [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/home), which is the largest Model-as-a-Service AI platform in China. During the process, I realized it's important to learn the mechanism and get a grounded understanding of how models work by doing hands-on experiments and projects. If you are also an AI beginner, and eager to step into the magic AI world, just join with me and start coding today! 

## Quick Start
- [Using Streamlit to build chat robots with LLMs â€” the fastest way!](Streamlit/Streamlit_learning.md)
- To see Python Basic progroms, move to **SwingPython** repository for more information
